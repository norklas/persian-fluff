# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

My motivation for this project was to further my knowledge with jQuery, Bootstrap, and Moment.js. One issue I managed to solve was using the **_each()_** method to loop through my blocks. I had originally done my code by selecting each block with jQuery, and writing a conditional for each one, but I knew there had to be a way to make it more efficient.

I learned how to use the **_each()_** method, and how to properly parse/format time with Moment.js As well as finally properly using the **_this_** keyword after struggling to use it in the past. I also learned how to read through documentation to learn how to use APIs.

## Installation

No installation required, as this will be a dynamic site. Please visit the site here, [Work Day Scheduler](https://norklas.github.io/persian-fluff/ "Work Day Scheduler")

## Usage

Input text by clicking on the text box. Upon clicking the save button, the text will save to localStorage and persist upon reload. The textblocks should change background color to match the time, grey boxes indicate that it is in the past, red boxes indicate that it is in the present, and green boxes indicate that it is in the future.
